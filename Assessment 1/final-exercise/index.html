    <h2>Current Role</h2>
    <p>
        As a network engineer I <strong>design</strong>, <strong>build</strong> and <strong>maintain</strong> networks both <strong>wired</strong> and <strong>wireless</strong>. In my current role I do this for prestigious hotel chains around the world and I have been lucky enough to visit some of these places. Mostly, I work remote maintaining systems we have in the field such as configuring networks to fit new needs and dealing with issues like switch failures for example. I have been on-site in the past configuring the equipment from the ground up, physically installing this and making it fit the customer requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I started my career as an apprentice 23/08/2016 with <a href='https://fourteenip.com/'>Fourteen IP Comms</a> who I still work for now. I completed this in Network Engineering and have since started a further education to complete a degree. For the past 5 years I have worked in our Technical Support department and my day to day role is supporting our customers remotely. I have also been involved in some great projects in traveling to America and Europe. I started my career as an apprentice 23/08/2016 with Fourteen IP Comms that I still work for now.

    <h2>Charity Work</h2>
    <p>
        I like treks and running and one day I realized people did them for charity while I was doing them <em>for fun</em>. So, I thought I could do that also, I am out here anyway so let’s give it a go. I did my first event 2016 running the Wigan 10K for a local charity called Joining Jack. Since then I have done numerous treks and runs for charities that are closure to my heart such as WWF, Dementia Friends and Alzheimer's Society.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a productive, easy to get along with person with a type-A personality. Trust me, this is not a brag nor is it one of those cheesy answers to ‘Tell me your weaknesses?’. You know the ones. Were your flaws being you just work too damn hard or care way too much. I make to do lists and schedule everything in my life and this is just how I keep things ticking over. It feels like a second job, one I manage well but wish I didn’t feel like I had to.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have many interests but passions I would say technology, music and starting a company. I lived with my Grandparents early on in my life and they are were into The Beatles. To keep me quite they would have me watch the Yellow Submarine film on repeat and from here it started. Technology is another root from my Grandad. He was an IT teacher and Network Engineer, so I have been into tech since a very young age.
    </p>

    <p>
        I really like the world of business and I would like to own my own tech start up some day. I read books like this of people who have started a company and managed to rise to the top in such a competitive industry. My favourite is Simon Sinek who teaches you to find the reason WHY you work. Very cheesy I know but my goal in life is to retire my friends and family and I have pledged to quite a few of them now that I will become a millionaire do so. I often get messages asking for the money in advance it being a sure thing and all.

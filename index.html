                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Jordan Prescott I study Software Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University. I am 22 years old so like most people born in the 90’s I now have an unhealthy addiction to technology. I spend way too much time on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/_jordanprescott/'>Instagram</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/_jordanprescott'>Twitter</a>. This doesn’t help my people skills, so I tend to get on better with computers and dogs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I was 10, I had got a new water gun and decided to test it out on my neighbors Yorkshire Terrier. What I thought would be a swift victory ended in a swift defeat. The dog decided he didn’t like being shot in the face and that he would bite mine. His teeth sank into my skin and one tooth into my <em>eye socket</em>. Nearly losing an eye you would think I would be <em>terrierfied</em> of dogs but in-fact I love them and own two, Bella and Lilly.

                <p>
                    This is a team of two pooches with one goal. To protect the garden from pigeons! They always keep a beady eye on the garden and when they see them, they shoot out the door barking away. All jobs are a success in shewing them off and letting everyone know about it. They are literally barking mad.
                </p>
                <p class='bgp-p-2'>
                    No pigeon is safe with these two around. Their motto is ‘Spot it, Spook it, Spoil me with treats’. Meet the team!

                <h3>Bella</h3>
                <p>
                    Bella is a rescue dog who was saved by the <a href='https://www.rspca.org.uk/'>RSPCA</a>. She was left on the side of a road in a box with her siblings. It was a cold rainy day in the early months of the year when she was saved. She was taken to <a href='https://www.leighdogsandcatshome.co.uk/'>Leigh Cats and Dogs Home</a> where I first met her, and she has been with me ever since. She is a mischievous, cheeky, lovable dog who’s favourite thing to do is play with her favourite toy and sleep.

                <h3 class="lilly-header">Lilly</h3>
                <p>
                    Lilly was born on a farm. She is the youngest and the most spoilt. Like always the youngest gets what they want so she always has the best toys and treats. She is fussy with food, so she has a different kind <em>of course</em> and she is very needy. Her favourite thing is being warm. If you have a hot water bottle or the fire on, she is the first over to join you. Do not dare move when this happens, or she will <em>steal your seat</em>.

                    <li>Breed: Westie</li>

                    Who is your favourite? You can decide with the button below. Bella <em>loves</em> her yellow ball and Lilly’s <strong>favourite</strong> is the pinkie brown reindeer.

                                This is Bella the dog. As I mentioned she likes to sleep but she does not like to be woken up. Here you see her with her head poking out from under the bed sheets looking rather sad. This picture was taken at 06:00 in the morning so this was an early start to the day. As you can see Bella was not feeling up to it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Although she loves being in bed there is one phrase that gets her going crazy. Nope, it is not “Walkies” its “Go get them!”. She thinks you mean pigeons are in the garden.

                                Bella is a watcher, and she does this from very odd places. Her favourites are the back of a couch like a cat, on the windowsill and the armchair. Here you can see her sat up in the armchair looking out the patio doors that oversee the back garden.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                While she does this, she often lets out a couple of hushed mumbled growls. I think she is saying “Dam pigeons in my garden. Your lucky I am on my break and if next door kicks the ball over again ill put my teeth through it”.

                                Lilly the Westie wrapped in soft fluffy blankets looking confused. She is very small and the youngest, so she is treated like a pup although she <strong>is not</strong>. She has come accustomed to the constant attention and now demands it. Here she is shocked and confused why we put her down on the bed and wondered when we will be picking her back up again. Due to this puppy like power she now runs the house and walks all over Bella. She has also taken it upon herself to promote herself to the manager of The Back Garden Protectors; a team of two.

                                Here we have Lilly wrapped in bed sheets with a pink hot water bottle and her favourite chew toy. Her favourite thing is being warm so as soon as she saw this she darted over. Originally my partner Becky had this and after ten minutes or so she had stolen it. 
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                Becky was not happy to have had this taken off her and to be kicked out of bed. She was cross and I think Lilly knew this as this is the look, she gave her. The classic puppy eyes. I tried this but it doesn’t work for me, I must not be doing it right.
